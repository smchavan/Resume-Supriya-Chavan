## PROJECT: #1
Designed and developed a UWP app, Music Library. We developed the app for displaying
general playlist and respective user’s playlist depending on the login. We used media elements for
rendering the media stored on your machine and playing the music in the media player. User is also able
to add his own music to the library. We used file handling for storing the Urls of the songs. Since we
were storing only the URLs of the songs, the application was very light for deployment.
Team Size: 4

## PROJECT  #2 
Designed and developed a console based Airline Reservation Management System in C++. Here
are the features of the system. Application will present a menu system of choice to the user to reserve a
seat, flight schedule, display passenger info, flight details, display user ticket information, Exit the
program.

## PROJECT #3

Designed and developed an EventBrite like Website using Micro services. We used MVC design
pattern for the application. For this project we developed 4 microservices as below:
Event, TokenService, Cart, Order and WebMvc for web integration of the microservices. Event
Microservice is used for storing all the details regarding the Events. TokenService is used for
authenticating the user for placing the order or accessing the cart.. Cart Microservice is used to store
cart information for the user. Order Microservice is used to store the order details for the orders placed
by the user. In our project, Event, Token, Cart, Order all were backend as well as front end services and
WebMvc was used to integrate the services with web which works is a front End. MSSQL server is used
as a backend for Event and Token Service. Redis Cache is used as a backend for Cart Service. Stripe 
Integration is used for processing the payments for user’s orders in Order Service. Rabbitmq is used for
messaging service.
We wrote APIs for each microservice to access the service using APIs. Views on the webpage will
make a call to WebMvc which will in turn call controllers (Controllers are written for each Microservice).
The controllers the call the respective service which will call the infrastructure to get the API paths and
those API paths are used to query the Microservices for information. Microservice will return the
requsted information to Infrastructure, which will be returned to respective service and then the service
will return it to controllers. After this Controller will return the information to WebMvc which will return
it to Views and which will be displayed using views.
Using Microservices for developing this application, we ensured the code is scalable for future
requirementsand distributed in nature. We also dockerized the application and we hosted each
microservice in one container on the docker.

## TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE:
### Software Development Bootcamp, Kal Academy, Redmond, WA		May 2019-Sept. 2019
To refresh my Programming skills, recently, I completed a Software Development BootCamp at Kal Academy. As part of the BootCamp, I led a team of fellow participants to develop a Music Library app, using Universal Windows Platform, a console based Airline Reservation Management System using C++, and a functional event website using four micro services that supported Events, TokenService, Cart, and Order Management. Through the BootCamp projects, I was able to not only able to further hone my programming skills but also develop team work and learn new technologies like Dockerizing, Postman, and Kubernetes. Impressed with my performance during the BootCamp, I was offered a Teaching Assistant position at the Kal Academy. As a Teaching Assistant, I am helping other participants hone their algorithm and programming skills.
